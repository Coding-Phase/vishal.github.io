                            The back propagation algorithm is used in layered feed-forward ANNs. It uses supervised
                            learning, which means the model trains itself with the use of target output.

                            Input data is then pre-processed and cleaned. That means it is checked with any outlier and
                            that is removed, missing values are entered, and data is checked if it is in the given range
                            for the given parameter. Later ANN is designed with number of input and output nodes, hidden
                            layers, activation function, and maximum number of epochs, weights, bias, goal and learning
                            function.

                            In this model we used K-nearest neighbour, MLP, SVM, GaussianNB. Here we had done a grid
                            search to find the best parameters to fit. While performing the grid search, we fitted the
                            grid search model with validation set obtained from the split.
