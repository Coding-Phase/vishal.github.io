                <p>In this Project we use Dataset containing different images of persons in which some wearing mask and
                    some not.
                    Dataset aims to study the face recognition problem in the mask occlusive environment to detect the
                    person not wearing mask. <br>

                        <li>
                            OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision
                            applications.
                            It mainly focusses on images processing, video capture and analysis including features
                            like Face detection and Object detection.
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            We have to unzip the folder and extract all the data from that and after extracting all
                            the dataset should be stored in a newly created new empty folder named "Dataset". We used
                            OpenCV to convert all the images into array and stored the features into X and the labels
                            into Y.
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            In this model we used K-nearest neighbour. Here we had done a grid search to find the best
                            parameters to fit. While performing the grid search, we fitted the grid search model with
                            validation set obtained from the split.
                        </li> <br>

                            Increasing the accuracy is a great challenge of any project and so was in our case, we tried
                            various methods to increase the accuracy like adding grid search, standardizing the data
                            etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
